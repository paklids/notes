    - Low stress retreival helps build long term memory
- To learn, struggle
- Mental models
    - Events > Patterns > Structure (Abstractions)
- Reflection KEY!
    - Incident reviews, focus less experienced engineers on attending

### Jamie Wilkison - A Treatise on the Metrology of Service Level Objectives
- Symptom Based Alerting
    - Anything that can measured by the SLO
- Start with identifying what you want to measure, not the measurments themselves
    - SLI (Indicator) - a carefully defined quantitative measure of some aspect of the level of service that is provided
    - SLO (Objective) - a target value or range of values for a service level that is measured by an SLI
    - SLA (Agreement) - an explicit or implicit contract with your users that includes consequences of meeting (or missing) the SLOs they contain


### Franka Schmidt - On-call Simulator! - Building an interactive game for teaching incident response
- On-call Onboarding

- On-Call Simulator Game 
    - Pick software (Twin light weight easy to use)
    - Find scenarios that new engineers can step through
    - Pick 


### Peter Bourgon - Observability: the Hard Parts

## Day 2

### Kishore Jalleda - Want to solve Over-Monitoring and Alert Fatigue? Create the right incentives!

### Peter Bailis - Next-Generation Observability for Next-Generation Data: Video, Sensors, Telemetry

### Aruna Sankaranarayanan (Mapbox) - Coordination through community: A swarm of friendly slack bots to improve knowledge sharing
- Small team, no documentation for a small team
    - Was using "Learn as you go" system
- Had timezone gap between US/India, had to rely heavily on documentation
- On-call onboarding & setup
    - Buddy system (3 months)
        - Phase 1 (1 Month)
            - Shadowing the primary engineer, mostly passively
        - Phase 2
            - Taking incidents together with buddy, but driving and handling smaller tasks
        - Phase 3
            - Taking incdients primarily, with bddy available for help if needed
- Monitoring system
    - Sumologic
        - Distributed logging/metrics platform
- Slack
    - Increases visibility
    - Timezone independant, easy to consume independently
    - Allows for more eyes on problems, and involves more junior engineers and support folks where they otherwise wouldnt be
- Slack bots
    - Help drive down the noise
    - Each bot Lambda function
        - @mapbox <command> <options>
    - Help increase visibility
        - SumoLogic queries
            - Used bot to make sumo queries simpler, and allows engineers who dont know the query language to interface with sumo

### Andy Domeier (SPS Commerce) - Automate Your Context
- https://github.com/adomeier/OperationalReadiness
- Value velocity / performance
    - Companies that ship faster, generally are succeeding
- Complexity stresses the need for context
    - Ask the right kinds of questions
    - Create a culture of curiosity
- Operational Readiness
    - A base set of consistent values for service delivery give you context about the app and enables you to make decisions
        - Operations Information
            - Who?
            - Where?
        - Performance
            - KPIs
            - Cost
        - Agility
            - Change effectiveness
            - Architecture & Resilliancy
        - Security
            - Sounds cool!

### Megan Kanne (Twitter) Automating Canary Analysis
- Kayenta (Open sourced by Google/Netflix)
- Simplify configuration of statistical tests

## Day 3

### Morgan McLean - Achieving Google-levels of Observability into your Application with OpenCensus
- OpenCensus.io
    - Single library supporting C++/Java/Go/Ruby/Python/.NET/Node
- Stack traces not enough for modern distributed systems
    - Need context, topology
- Exporters (Jaeger, Prometheus)
    - Allows to export to other backends
- Works out of the box with Istio
    - Look up Morgan's 2017 KubeCon Istio talk

### Yan Cui - The present and future of Serverless observability
- Lose many capabilities you rely on in server-oriented world (agents, daemons, etc)

### Prateek Rungta - Putting billions of timeseries to work at Uber with autonomous monitoring
- 2014-2015: Graphite
    - No replication, very difficult to operate
- 2015-2016: Cassandra
    - 16x YoY growth, very expensive (1600 nodes)
    - Ended up having to lose redndancy to handle compactions

### Allan Espin - Bloomberg - Autoscaling containers with math
- 

### Kale Stedman - Assisted Remediation: By trying to build an autoremediation system, we realized we never actually wanted one

### Dave Cadwallader - Security through Observability

### Beth Cornils - How to include Whistler, Kate Libby, and appreciate that our differences make our teams better.
